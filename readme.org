Expense Splitter App Workflow:
1. User signs up for site, they put in an email and password - maybe sso?
2. User generates a 'group' link and they send it to people who can join the group
3. All people in group can see all of their groups by most recent and add expenses to choose how they are split
   - Can be a percentage or amount assigned per person or split evenly by a subset of the group
4. Each person can see a running score of how much they owe to the group expense.
5. Somehow handle tax and tip nicely (as portion of how much that person owes for the expense)
6. Not now but crazy stretch goal: receipt OCR


1. Simple Users table for now, contains user id, email, and password (don't encourage real passwords yet, just to start then sso)
   - /login - get: see login page, post: login using existing creds
2. Group table that has a group link id and some metadata about the group like when it was created
   - Group Link table that has a user id column and a group they are in. Just two columns
   - /groups/{user_id} get: get groups this user is in
   - /groups post: add to new group using this link
3. expenses table, expense id and info about expense - not sure how to do it yet bc need to keep track of who owes it etc
