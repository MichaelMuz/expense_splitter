Expense Splitter App Workflow:
1. User signs up for site, they put in an email and password - maybe sso?
2. User generates a 'group' link and they send it to people who can join the group
3. All people in group can see all of their groups by most recent and add expenses to choose how they are split
   - Can be a percentage or amount assigned per person or split evenly by a subset of the group
4. Each person can see a running score of how much they owe to the group expense.
5. Somehow handle tax and tip nicely (as portion of how much that person owes for the expense)
6. Not now but crazy stretch goal: receipt OCR


1. Simple User table for now, contains user id, email, and password (don't encourage real passwords yet, just to start then sso)
   - /api/auth/register - post: create new user account
   - /api/auth/login - post: login using existing creds
2. Group table that has a group id, name, invite_code (unique), and created_at
   - GroupMembership table that has user_id, group_id, role (owner/member), and joined_at. This is the join table for the many-to-many relationship between users and groups.
   - GET /api/users/:user_id/groups - get groups this user is in
   - POST /api/groups - create new group (generates unique invite_code)
   - POST /api/groups/:group_id/join - join group using invite_code in request body
   - GET /api/groups/:group_id - get group details and members

     don't do this yet need to handle percentages that autoupdate on updated totals
3. Expenses table: expense_id, group_id, description, total_amount, paid_by_user_id, created_at
   - ExpenseSplits table: split_id, expense_id, user_id, amount_owed, is_paid
   - POST /api/groups/:group_id/expenses - create new expense with splits
   - GET /api/groups/:group_id/expenses - get all expenses for a group
   - GET /api/users/:user_id/balance - get how much user owes/is owed across all groups
   - PATCH /api/expenses/:expense_id/splits/:split_id - mark a split as paid

Expenses table: expense_id, group_id, description, total_amount, paid_by_user_id, created_at
Expense split table needs to support:
1. Even split with group - easiest
2. Specific dollar amount assigned to each person
3. Specific percentage amount assigned to each person
4. Ability to do these but not include everyone in the group, like only me jack and jill split this

Expenses table:
expense_id, group_id, description, total_amount, paid_by_user_id,  created_at
ExpenseSplit:
expense_id, user_id,  amount_owed, paid (Y/N)
